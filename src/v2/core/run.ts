/**
 * ikbi v2 — THE CANONICAL RUN FUNCTION. The production spine.
 *
 * Every v2 surface (CLI today; server, REPL, delegation later) enters HERE. There is
 * one of these, and adding a second would be an obvious, reviewable act rather than
 * the quiet accretion that gave v1 several de facto build paths.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SLICE ACTUALLY DOES — and what it truthfully refuses to claim:
 *
 *   1. mint a task identity and a run identity
 *   2. open the canonical lifecycle
 *   3. enter `preflight` and validate the request (goal, strategy, repository) —
 *      READ-ONLY: it stats paths, nothing more
 *   4. resolve CONFIGURATION TRUTH inside preflight: what this machine can invoke
 *      (provider inventory), what strategy the operator selected (active profile),
 *      and whether the two are coherent — producing ONE immutable
 *      `RuntimeModelPolicy`, recorded on the lifecycle ledger
 *   5. STOP, because `context` (the next stage) has no implementation in this build
 *   6. terminalize as `failed` with category `not_implemented`, and emit a receipt
 *      whose evidence block is counted from the ledger: zero invocations, zero
 *      candidates, zero verifications, not promoted, repository not mutated
 *
 * It performs NO model call, NO workspace allocation, NO mutation, NO promotion.
 * Configuration is read-only observation — reading a roster file and a profile file
 * is not invoking anything. The receipt says exactly that, because the receipt has no
 * way to say anything else.
 *
 * `model_resolution` is NOT entered. The lifecycle would now permit it (configuration
 * has been recorded), which is the point: the precondition is real and satisfied, and
 * the stage is still absent because V2-003 has not been written.
